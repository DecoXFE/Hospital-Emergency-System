# Hospital Emergency System 🏥
## Overview
This repository contains the project developed as part of the Software Design subject for 3rd Year Computer Engineering. The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a Hospital Emergency Management System 🩺 using key technologies and design principles covered in the course. The system is developed using Java, Swing for the user interface, and applies architectural design patterns for a robust, maintainable solution.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

📁 app/: Contains the application code, including business logic, data management, and interaction with external services.
📁 models/: Includes data UML models used within the application.
📁 documentation/: Holds detailed documentation about the use cases, system functionalities, and acceptance tests.

## Technologies Used
- ☕ Java: The system is implemented in Java, leveraging its object-oriented features for a scalable design.
- 🖥️ Swing: The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Java Swing.
- 📐 UML: Unified Modeling Language (UML) was used during the design phase to model the system. However, the final documentation for CU4 lacks these - diagrams even though its completely functional.
- 🧩 Architectural Design Patterns: The project follows architectural patterns to ensure modularity, flexibility, and maintainability of the system.

## How to Run 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/DecoXFE/Hospital-Emergency-System
cd Hospital-Emergency-System
```
2. Run the application with your preferred IDE.
